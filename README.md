# HC-assessment
This is a project where one can add new people to the database and show person's data from database.

I used visula studio 2019, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server for database, Entity framework ORM for this project.

Open data.sql file and execute it in your local database. Then the data will be added. and you can search or add new data to it.

I did my best to satisfy minimum requirements of the project. Look into it.
